## 10/28/2025 7 PM - thought out the main features  

![explosivecat](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjE5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b62d2de114c81411ba98933ecdbaabfbb3683907/explosivecat.png)
currently consists of these features:

- SIM Card Interface to allow for calling to non-pager devices and messaging
- Rescue mode, automatically sends your location to your emergency contacts, and calls 911.
- Games, you can program games into your pager or play the builtin ones (small shooter, tic tac toe, etc)
- AI chatbot, because why not stuff AI into everything. (Gemini since it's free)
- Search Engine, because we stuffed AI into everything and now nothing works
- Morse code typing, and virtual keyboard typing 
- LoRA based network, to allow for communication to nearby pagers, network hopping is enabled
- Encryption, well because network hopping is enabled, to prevent eavesdropping
- Modules, (Keyboard Module, Joystick Module for games and more)
- 6 button interface (Directions, Ok, Back)
 
  

## 10/28/2025 9 PM - choosing the parts and making the BOM  

I've been choosing the parts for my pager, so the basics:

Computer: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
LoRA Module: EBYTE E220-900T22D 
Wifi Gateway: ESP32 Mini
GPS Module: NEO-6M![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjIzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--46997878686686d531209794d0298d63214a1af5/image.png)


anyways, i'll work more on this later!!!!  

## 10/29/2025 - still choosing the parts and ALOT of research  

uh so turns out i'm stupid, raspberry pi zero 2 w already handles wifi so no wifi gateway needed.
I now have everything I need

and we have a sim card module (sim800l) I wasn't planning on this since 2g is barely supported but 
turns out I can use 4/5g sims and my carrier will fallback to a 2g network.

we also have an accelerometer/gyro, and compass

and buck converters, this is getting a little expensive![pager](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQ5OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--36d422a4c051ff42a39defdddf16dc0b4eecd184/pager.png)

  

## 10/30/2025 - finalized most parts, now onto UI and software side  

I've finalized most parts, though there may be some additions/removals, I've uploaded the csv for everyone.

After the UI and apps are done, I'll make the schematics and pcb, though I'm not sure whether I should use a pcb or wires, since most of the components are pcbs as well.

I'm keeping in mind security, by encrypting all LoRA network messages with algorithms _simillar_ to
the Diffie-Hoffmann key exchange, as it's itself too resource-intensive for a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

## 11/2/2025 - Making the UI  

So the parts have been finalized, Now onto the UI and PCB.

I've made the first version of the UI, it does look like some 2000's era phone UI but whatever

I've also started work on making a schematic for the pcb, I don't know 3d modelling 
(the banner model was made by a friend, but it's only for display)
So I'll have to learn that and making a pcb both together, very fun.

I did forget to post a journal entry so yeah.
