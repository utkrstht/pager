## 10/28/2025 7 PM - thought out the main features  

![explosivecat](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjE5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b62d2de114c81411ba98933ecdbaabfbb3683907/explosivecat.png)
currently consists of these features:

- SIM Card Interface to allow for calling to non-pager devices and messaging
- Rescue mode, automatically sends your location to your emergency contacts, and calls 911.
- Games, you can program games into your pager or play the builtin ones (small shooter, tic tac toe, etc)
- AI chatbot, because why not stuff AI into everything. (Gemini since it's free)
- Search Engine, because we stuffed AI into everything and now nothing works
- Morse code typing, and virtual keyboard typing 
- LoRA based network, to allow for communication to nearby pagers, network hopping is enabled
- Encryption, well because network hopping is enabled, to prevent eavesdropping
- Modules, (Keyboard Module, Joystick Module for games and more)
- 6 button interface (Directions, Ok, Back)
 
  

## 10/28/2025 9 PM - choosing the parts and making the BOM  

I've been choosing the parts for my pager, so the basics:

Computer: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
LoRA Module: EBYTE E220-900T22DÂ 
Wifi Gateway: ESP32 Mini
GPS Module: NEO-6M![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjIzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--46997878686686d531209794d0298d63214a1af5/image.png)


anyways, i'll work more on this later!!!!  

## 10/29/2025 - still choosing the parts and ALOT of research  

uh so turns out i'm stupid, raspberry pi zero 2 w already handles wifi so no wifi gateway needed.
I now have everything I need

and we have a sim card module (sim800l) I wasn't planning on this since 2g is barely supported but 
turns out I can use 4/5g sims and my carrier will fallback to a 2g network.

we also have an accelerometer/gyro, and compass

and buck converters, this is getting a little expensive![pager](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQ5OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--36d422a4c051ff42a39defdddf16dc0b4eecd184/pager.png)
