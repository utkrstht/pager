## 10/28/2025 7 PM - thought out the main features  

![explosivecat](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjE5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b62d2de114c81411ba98933ecdbaabfbb3683907/explosivecat.png)
currently consists of these features:

- SIM Card Interface to allow for calling to non-pager devices and messaging
- Rescue mode, automatically sends your location to your emergency contacts, and calls 911.
- Games, you can program games into your pager or play the builtin ones (small shooter, tic tac toe, etc)
- AI chatbot, because why not stuff AI into everything. (Gemini since it's free)
- Search Engine, because we stuffed AI into everything and now nothing works
- Morse code typing, and virtual keyboard typing 
- LoRA based network, to allow for communication to nearby pagers, network hopping is enabled
- Encryption, well because network hopping is enabled, to prevent eavesdropping
- Modules, (Keyboard Module, Joystick Module for games and more)
- 6 button interface (Directions, Ok, Back)
