![explosivecat](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjE5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b62d2de114c81411ba98933ecdbaabfbb3683907/explosivecat.png)
currently consists of these features:

- SIM Card Interface to allow for calling to non-pager devices and messaging (MAY BE REMOVED)

- Rescue mode, automatically sends your location to your emergency contacts, and calls 911 and sends an alert to all ems pager devices within 15km pointing to your location.
 
- Games, you can program games into your pager or play the builtin ones (simple shooter, tic tac toe, and more)
 
- AI chatbot, because why not stuff AI into everything. (Gemini since it's free)
 
- Search Engine, because we stuffed AI into everything and now nothing works
 
- Morse code typing, and virtual keyboard typing
 
- LoRA based network, to allow for communication without sim card to nearby pagers to increase range, network hopping is enabled

- Encryption, well because network hopping is enabled, to prevent eavesdropping
 
- Modules, (Keyboard Module, Joystick Module for games and more)
 
- 6 button interface (Directions, Ok, Back)
